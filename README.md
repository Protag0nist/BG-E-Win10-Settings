# BG-E-Win10-Settings
These are the settings that I found let me run the game with a minimal amount of issues. With these settings I no longer experience audio de-sync issues, animations that play to quickly, graphical glitches. I've saved these settings on Github so there archived &amp; to potentially help others that have ran into similar problems.
